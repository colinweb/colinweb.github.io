	 <strong><li>"I had an experience in the very basics of Wix.com when I was in high school. I would love to learn more and think that it is a vital skill for me since I am interested in business as well!"" </li></strong>
	 <li>"I don't really have any experience other than tinkering with html on tumblr in like 2015"</li>
	 <strong><li>"I have created websites for school projects before mostly in high school--nothing too notable or memorable. I have used templates like Wix."</li></strong>
	 <li>"I have created websites for school projects before mostly in high school--nothing too notable or memorable. I have used templates like Wix."</li>
	  <strong><li>"I have absolutely no experience in web design, but I'm really excited that we're covering it in class because I'm interested in making my own website for my art."</li></strong>
	 <li>"Last semester, I had to create a website as a portfolio for an RA preparatory class. I created this website using Wix.com and I also have seen and tried out creating an html website in High School.  I also briefly glanced over it during a technology portion of a secondary general ed course as apart of my Music Ed curriculum."</li>
	 <strong><li>"I do not have any experience with web design. However, I always wanted to make my own website! I know that there are plenty of computer languages like HTML, R, python, C++, but I have no idea what they are or what the difference between them are."</li></strong>
	  <li>"I have a little expierence in web design. I have created a few facebook pages, but never an individual design page."</li>
	  <strong><li>"I have very little experience working with web design and building a website in general. The most i have done is working on basic coding and website assignments for my new media 1 class. I somewhat know what i can do to make website but need a lot more experience."</li></strong>
	  <li>"Sadly, I have basically no experience in web design or development. I have always maintained somewhat of an interest in things such as coding, but mostly for its
conceptual/abstract "dimensions." However, I like creating things, so I am interested to learn more in the upcoming class(es)."</li>
	 <strong> <li>"Web design is one of my favorite things to do. I've been making websites here and there since middle school with HTML. I have a little bit of experience in Dreamweaver too. I also like to use CodePen and customize some of the designs on there and add them to my sites."</li></strong>
	  <li>"I have always want to make an website even though I have never had any web site experience."</li>
	 <strong><li>"I have never tried to make a website. I have never really needed to create a website so I don't have any experience with web design. I would love to try and make one but I don't know what I would make one for. I do have some experience with graphic design so this could help me with the design aspect of it but I would definitely have to learn more about putting one together using the w3schools website. I am excited to try to do some web design because this is the first thing in this class that I have not done already so far."</li></strong>
