<h2><i>Sherpa Professional Coaching</i></h2><p>In 2018, I created 16 "Coach Profiles" and a conference highlight video for Sherpa Professional Coaching LLC. It was my first professional freelance project. I used two cameras and external lights to create intimate profile videos for several Sherpa Coaches at their 2018 EXPO Conference in Cincinnati, Ohio. Here you can see my highlight video that includes shots from coach profiles and other footage from the conference.</p>
