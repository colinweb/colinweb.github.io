  During class I went through the "Integrated Media 1 page on this website.  You can read through that.  The screenshots of code on that page are source code for the "features" page on this website.  Coding can seem like a lot, but it's really not that bad.  Your first assignment is to write a page of code.  Since it was an in class group project, all the no shows can be in a group together.  You are only responsible for your own page.  Check out the "Project 4" page for more details.  <br>
	  
	Happy Coding!
